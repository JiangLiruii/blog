#### Page Build Warning

There are many possible reasons to cause a "Page Build Warning" email or similar error.

One of these is that github changes its build environment.

> You are attempting to use the 'pygments' highlighter, which is currently unsupported on GitHub Pages. Your site will use 'rouge' for highlighting instead. To suppress this warning, change the 'highlighter' value to 'rouge' in your '_config.yml'.

So, just edit `_config.yml`, find `highlighter: pygments`, change it to `highlighter: rouge` and the warning will be gone.

For other circumstances, check out existing issues or create a new one!
